        The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}. 

        Test solutions in the console. 

        It looks like the best practice solution is very similar to mine but they use ternary expressions instead. 

        However, with mine, I first ask if the property of the object doesn't exist and then if it doesn't, I assign it the value zero and add. They ask if it exists and if it does they add 1, otherwise they assign it the value 1.
