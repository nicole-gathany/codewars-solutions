    <h1>shorter concat [reverse longer]</h1>
    <h2>7kyu</h2>
    <p>
        Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form: shorter+reverse(longer)+shorter.

In other words, the shortest string has to be put as prefix and as suffix of the reverse of the longest.

Strings a and b may be empty, but not null (In C# strings may also be null. Treat them as if they are empty.).
If a and b have the same length treat a as the longer producing b+reverse(a)+b
