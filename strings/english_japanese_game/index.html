<h1> Background:</h1>
    <p>
        
In Japan, a game called Shiritori is played. The rules are simple, a group of people take turns calling out a word whose beginning syllable is the same as the previous player's ending syllable. For example, the first person would say the word ねこ, and the second player must make a word that starts with こ, like　こむぎ. This repeats until a player can not think of a word fast enough or makes a word that ends in ん, because there are no words that begin with ん　in the Japanese language.

English Shiritori has the same principle, with the first and last letters of words. That being said the lose condition is saying a word that doesn't start with the previous word's last letter or not saying a word quick enough.

For example: apple -> eggs -> salmon -> nut -> turkey ...

<h1>Your Task:</h1>
<p>
You will be given a list of strings, a transcript of an English Shiritori match. Your task is to find out if the game ended early, and return a list that contains every valid string until the mistake. If a list is empty return an empty list. If one of the elements is an empty string, that is invalid and should be handled.
</p>
        
        

       <h2> Examples:</h2> 
       <h3> All elements valid:</h3> 
       <p>

     The array {"dog","goose","elephant","tiger","rhino","orc","cat"} </p>
       <p>
                   should return {"dog","goose","elephant","tiger","rhino","orc","cat"}

       </p> 
        
        An invalid element at index 2:
        The array {"dog","goose","tiger","cat", "elephant","rhino","orc"}
        
        should return ("dog","goose") since goose ends in 'e' and tiger starts with 't'
        
        An invalid empty string at index 2:
        The array {"ab","bc","","cd"}
        
        should return ("ab","bc")
        
        All invalid empty string at index 0:
        The array {"","bc","","cd"}
        
        should return An Empty List
